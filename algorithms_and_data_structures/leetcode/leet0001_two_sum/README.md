# Two Sum

Write a function that that takes two arguments:

- A list of integers
- A target integer value

And returns a tuple with the indexes of the first two elements in the list that add up
to the target value.

Assume that there's always exactly one (not more, not less) solution in every input
list.

The function signature is:

```python
def two_sum(nums: list[float], target: float ) -> tuple[float, float]
```
