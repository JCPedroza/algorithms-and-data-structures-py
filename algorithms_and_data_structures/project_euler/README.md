# Project Euler

From [Project Euler][1]:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the
use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most
problems.

From [Wikipedia][2]:

> Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series
of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The
project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer
programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has
gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes 789 problems as of
14 March 2022, with a new one added approximately every week. Problems
are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU
time using an efficient algorithm, in any programming language, on a modestly
powered computer. As of 27 April 2021, Project Euler has more than 1,000,000
users who have solved at least one problem, in over 100 different programming
languages.
