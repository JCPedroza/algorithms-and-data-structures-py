# Higher-Order Function

A higher order function is a function that returns a function or takes a function as
an argument (procedural parameter). In other words, it is a function with another
function involved in its interface.

This is possible in languages that treat functions as values (first-class functions). It
can be simulated using function pointers in languages without first-class functions,
like C.

First-order functions are functions that do not have another function involved in its
interface.

Some popular higher-order functions include `map`, `filter`, `reduce` (aka `fold`).
