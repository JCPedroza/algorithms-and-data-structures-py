# Bubble Sort

* Repeatedly iterate through the list, one item at a time
* Compare current item with its right neighbor, swap if they are not in order
* Go to next number
* Repeat unit list is ordered

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- Best: `O(n)`
- Average: `O(n^2)`
- Worst: `O(n^2)`

### Space Complexity

- Total: `O(n)`
- Auxiliary: `O(1)`
