# Algorithms and Data Structures

Each implementation module includes the algorithm, or data structure, or
solution, binded to a variable that has a specific name for each section:

- For algorithms, the identifier is `algorithm`
- For data structures, the identifier is `structure`
- For project euler, the identifier is `solution`

Every implementation module must also include a `name` field that identifies
and differentiates that implementation from others.

In other words, the expected interface for all implementations has two
components:

- The implementation of the algorithm, or data structure, or solution itself
- And the name of the implementation
